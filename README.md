**MoviesFlixWeb** is a purpose-built **streaming platform** for movie and TV lovers 🎬 — not a shallow UI clone but a working, modern product with **first-class UX**, **powerful search**, and an **integrated playback experience** ▶️.

## Key Highlights

- ✅ **Purposeful video streaming**: built-in streaming player with adaptive UI for movies, trailers, and episodic TV playback — a core product feature that goes beyond static data displays. **Play full-length content** and trailers in a unified player ▶️🔥
- 🎨 **Unique UI & visuals**: custom components like **LiquidGlass**, **Orb**, and **Dock** (plus animated loaders) give the site a premium, cinematic look — a visual language you won't find in typical clones ✨
- ⚡ **Fast modern stack**: Vite + React + Tailwind CSS for ultrafast dev feedback and a responsive, accessible interface.
- 🔎 **Search-first experience**: discover content quickly via the Search page and contextual detail pages (movies, people, TV shows).
- 🚀 **Production-ready**: configured for Vercel for instant global delivery and fast edge caching.

## Demo & Deployment

The site is deployed on Vercel. If you haven't already, connect your repo to Vercel — the included `vite` configuration will build automatically.

Live demo: **https://themoviesflix.vercel.app/** 🌐

## What makes MoviesFlixWeb special

- 🎯 **Real streaming workflow**: integrated streaming routes and playback components so visitors can **play full-length content and trailers** in a unified player — not just embedded iframes. This is the end-to-end user flow: **discover → detail → stream**.
- ✨ **Attention to UI detail**: components like **LiquidGlass**, **Orb**, **Dock**, and **TrendingContainer** implement polished motion and glassmorphism effects that give the site a premium cinematic brand.
- 🔍 **Designed for discoverability**: each detail page (movie, TV, person) is structured and metadata-ready so it can be extended for SEO and social previews (rich cards, JSON-LD).

## Tech stack

- Framework: **React (Vite)**
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS** + custom fonts
- State management: local store with slices in `src/store` (movies, people, tv)
- HTTP client: **Axios** at `src/utils/axios.js`
- Routing: **React Router** (see `src/routes/RouterHandler.jsx`)

## Project structure (excerpt)

- `src/Components` — UI and page components (Card, Navbar, Loaders, Dock, LiquidGlass)
- `src/store` — Redux-like slices and actions (moviesSlice, peopleSlicer, tvSlice)
- `src/utils/axios.js` — API client
- `index.html` — main HTML with root and meta

## Screens & Features

- 🏠 **Home**: curated lists, trending carousel, and featured content
- 🔎 **Search**: full-text search with fast results and instant previews
- 🎞️ **Movie/TV detail pages**: cast, seasons, reviews, trailers, and a dedicated **Stream** button
- ▶️ **Stream pages**: optimized playback layout with keyboard accessibility, responsive controls, and an immersive viewing UI
- 👤 **People pages**: biography, credits, and media galleries

Notes

- ⚠️ The project expects a movie/TV data source (TMDB or similar) and an asset/streaming backend for protected content. For demos the code can be pointed at a public API.

## Environment / configuration

- Provide API keys via environment variables (example - replace with your provider):

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Add these in Vercel project settings as environment variables for production.

## SEO & Social preview

The project includes an `index.html` file you can extend with meta tags, Open Graph tags, Twitter Card tags, and JSON-LD structured data. This improves link previews and search appearance — **important for discoverability** 🔍📣.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add structured JSON-LD examples to `index.html` for VideoObject and WebSite
- Add more precise SEO tags (canonical, robots, social images) tailored to your Vercel URL

If you want me to update `index.html` now, I'll proceed to add recommended SEO/meta tags and JSON-LD structured data.
